# Krimble Changes

This file tracks fixes and changes made in this fork (Krimble) on top of
upstream Krita, specifically for the Android build. It is not exhaustive
history — it's a running log of notable bugs found and fixed, so future
work (by anyone, including an AI assistant with no memory of past
sessions) can see what's already been addressed and why, without having
to rediscover it from scratch.

## Standing rules for this fork

- **Never delete menu/action XML entries.** Comment them out (`<!-- -->`)
  instead. A deletion buried in an unrelated commit is silent and
  unrecoverable without git archaeology (see the Close All incident
  below); a comment is visible in the file itself and easy to restore.
- **Photoshop feature parity — same features, same menu locations — is
  the primary UI goal** for this fork.

## 2026-09-02 — File/Edit/View toolbar items silently deleted, restored

**File:** `krita/krita5.xmlgui`

`file_close`, `file_close_all`, `file_quit` (File toolbar/menu) and
`toggle-selection-overlay-mode`, `show-global-selection-mask`,
`view_show_canvas_only`, `fullscreen` (View toolbar) were all deleted in
commit `718e83878` ("Update krita5.xmlgui", 2026-08-24, George Edward
Purdy). That commit bundled these deletions together with unrelated
cleanup across three different toolbar blocks in one generic-message
commit, with no indication any of it was intentional — it has the
signature of accidental collateral damage from a broader toolbar-trim
pass, not a deliberate decision to drop Close All specifically.

All of the above still had valid, registered actions (nothing else
referenced them, but they weren't gone from the codebase) and have been
restored, with comments explaining why, per the no-delete rule above.

## Missing Photoshop-parity features (not just menu entries — the underlying feature doesn't exist)

Found while restoring the toolbar deletions above: two groups of actions
were referenced in the pre-`718e83878` menu but no longer exist
*anywhere* in the codebase — not in any `.action` file, not registered
via `createAction()` in any `.cpp`. These aren't menu-restoration jobs;
the feature itself needs to be built:

- **File > Print / Print One Copy** (`file_print`, `file_print_preview`)
  — Photoshop has both under File. No print implementation currently
  exists in this codebase at all.
- **Edit > Find and Replace** (`edit_find`, `edit_find_next`,
  `edit_find_prev`, `edit_replace`) — Photoshop has Find and Replace Text
  under Edit. No find/replace implementation currently exists in this
  codebase at all (this would apply to text layers/the text tool,
  Krita's closest equivalent to Photoshop's text-focused find/replace).

Left commented out in `krita5.xmlgui` at their original menu locations so
the intended placement isn't lost, pending a full menu-by-menu Photoshop
parity audit (comparing every menu against
`PHOTOSHOP_27_MENUS.TXT`/`Adobephotoshopshortcutkeyspdf.pdf` in the
project files) to catalog anything else in the same situation.



**Commit:** `b1eb52e`
**File:** `plugins/color/lcms2engine/LcmsColorSpace.h`

`createBrightnessContrastAdjustment()` built its LittleCMS device link
tagged as `cmsSigLabData` and chained it between two copies of the
working ICC profile (`RGB -> "Lab" -> RGB`, via
`cmsCreateMultiprofileTransform`). Tagging the link as Lab makes
LittleCMS perform a *real* colorimetric conversion into and out of Lab,
which is subject to the profile's rendering intent and gamut mapping.
That round-trip could keep true black (0,0,0) and true white (255,255,255)
from mapping back to themselves exactly, which is what caused the
Brightness/Contrast filter to not reach full black/white even at extreme
slider values.

The filter's own curve math (in
`plugins/filters/colorsfilters/kis_brightness_contrast_filter.cpp`)
already clamps to a full 0.0–1.0 range and was never the problem — the
bug was purely in how the resulting curve got applied at the LittleCMS
level.

**Fix:** build the device link using the color space's own signature
(`this->colorSpaceSignature()`) and apply it with a single-profile
`cmsCreateTransform`, exactly the same pattern already used correctly a
few lines down in `createPerChannelAdjustment()` in the same file. No
Lab conversion, no rendering-intent-dependent round trip — the curve is
applied directly to the working color space's own channels, so its own
clamping is what determines the output range.

## 2026-09-02 — Play Store icon for "Next"/debug flavor still showed stock Krita paintbrush

**Commit:** `a1b59e8`

An earlier fix (`a4a5b53`) corrected the adaptive-icon foreground and all
mipmap-density launcher icons to the Krimble gear/K mark, but missed
`packaging/android/apk/ic_launcher_next-playstore.png` — the Play Store
listing image for the debug/"next" build flavor, which was still the
original Krita paintbrush + git-branch badge artwork. Replaced with the
same Krimble gear/K image used for the main flavor's Play Store icon.

## 2026-09-02 — Debug/"Next" flavor icon made visually distinct

**Commit:** `dae8061`

The debug ("Next") build flavor's launcher icon was identical to the
release flavor's icon (same gear/K artwork, no visual distinction),
making it hard to tell debug and release installs apart on-device.
Generated a distinct variant: the same Krimble gear/K mark desaturated
to a grayscale/steel tone, with an orange circular "N" badge overlaid in
the bottom-right corner. Applied across all mipmap densities
(`mdpi` through `xxxhdpi`), both square and round variants, and the
debug flavor's Play Store PNG.

## 2026-09-03 — Added real "Merge Visible" action (Photoshop parity, Ctrl+Shift+E)

**Commit:** `e1a7e5a`
**Files:** `libs/ui/kis_layer_manager.h`, `libs/ui/kis_layer_manager.cc`,
`krita/krita.action`, `krita/krita5.xmlgui`

Photoshop's Layer menu has a dedicated "Merge Visible" command
(Ctrl+Shift+E) between Merge Down and Flatten Image. Krita has always
had the equivalent capability, but only as a two-step manual sequence
(per the Krita manual): Layer ▸ Select ▸ Visible Layers, then Layer ▸
Merge with Layer Below. No single menu item triggered both steps.

Added a new `merge_visible_layers` action to `KisLayerManager` that
does exactly that sequence and nothing else — it calls
`KisNodeManager::selectVisibleNodes()` then the existing
`mergeLayer()` slot, which already handles merging a multi-node
selection via `KisImage::mergeMultipleLayers()`. No new merge logic
was written.

**Bonus fix:** while placing the new action, found that the Layer
menu's existing `flatten_layer` entry was mislabeled "Merge Visible"
in `krita5.xmlgui`, even though `flatten_layer` only flattens the
single active layer — it has nothing to do with visible-layer merging.
Relabeled that entry to its correct text, "Flatten Layer", and inserted
the new `merge_visible_layers` action in the correct Photoshop-parity
position (between Merge Down and Flatten Image).

**Shortcut:** Photoshop uses Ctrl+Shift+E for Merge Visible and has no
default shortcut for Flatten Image. Krita had Ctrl+Shift+E assigned to
`flatten_image`. Moved the shortcut from `flatten_image` to the new
`merge_visible_layers` action to match Photoshop's defaults.

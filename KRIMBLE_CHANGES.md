# Krimble Changes

This file tracks fixes and changes made in this fork (Krimble) on top of
upstream Krita, specifically for the Android build. It is not exhaustive
history — it's a running log of notable bugs found and fixed, so future
work (by anyone, including an AI assistant with no memory of past
sessions) can see what's already been addressed and why, without having
to rediscover it from scratch.

## 2026-09-02 — Brightness/Contrast not reaching full black/white

**Commit:** `b1eb52e`
**File:** `plugins/color/lcms2engine/LcmsColorSpace.h`

`createBrightnessContrastAdjustment()` built its LittleCMS device link
tagged as `cmsSigLabData` and chained it between two copies of the
working ICC profile (`RGB -> "Lab" -> RGB`, via
`cmsCreateMultiprofileTransform`). Tagging the link as Lab makes
LittleCMS perform a *real* colorimetric conversion into and out of Lab,
which is subject to the profile's rendering intent and gamut mapping.
That round-trip could keep true black (0,0,0) and true white (255,255,255)
from mapping back to themselves exactly, which is what caused the
Brightness/Contrast filter to not reach full black/white even at extreme
slider values.

The filter's own curve math (in
`plugins/filters/colorsfilters/kis_brightness_contrast_filter.cpp`)
already clamps to a full 0.0–1.0 range and was never the problem — the
bug was purely in how the resulting curve got applied at the LittleCMS
level.

**Fix:** build the device link using the color space's own signature
(`this->colorSpaceSignature()`) and apply it with a single-profile
`cmsCreateTransform`, exactly the same pattern already used correctly a
few lines down in `createPerChannelAdjustment()` in the same file. No
Lab conversion, no rendering-intent-dependent round trip — the curve is
applied directly to the working color space's own channels, so its own
clamping is what determines the output range.

## 2026-09-02 — Play Store icon for "Next"/debug flavor still showed stock Krita paintbrush

**Commit:** `a1b59e8`

An earlier fix (`a4a5b53`) corrected the adaptive-icon foreground and all
mipmap-density launcher icons to the Krimble gear/K mark, but missed
`packaging/android/apk/ic_launcher_next-playstore.png` — the Play Store
listing image for the debug/"next" build flavor, which was still the
original Krita paintbrush + git-branch badge artwork. Replaced with the
same Krimble gear/K image used for the main flavor's Play Store icon.

## 2026-09-02 — Debug/"Next" flavor icon made visually distinct

**Commit:** `dae8061`

The debug ("Next") build flavor's launcher icon was identical to the
release flavor's icon (same gear/K artwork, no visual distinction),
making it hard to tell debug and release installs apart on-device.
Generated a distinct variant: the same Krimble gear/K mark desaturated
to a grayscale/steel tone, with an orange circular "N" badge overlaid in
the bottom-right corner. Applied across all mipmap densities
(`mdpi` through `xxxhdpi`), both square and round variants, and the
debug flavor's Play Store PNG.
